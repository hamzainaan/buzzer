# HOW TO COMPILE BUZZER?

- The compilation process has been made very easy. If you have the C++ compiler built into your PC, there are a few ways to do it. In the folder where the "Makefile" file is located, it will be enough to open a terminal and enter the following commands.
> make build
> strip buzzer
